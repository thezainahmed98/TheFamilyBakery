      <div class="user-comment"><strong>"The Family Bakery did an amazing job with the cake and desserts I ordered this weekend. All the flavors I ordered were delicious. Not only did the kids enjoy, but the adults loved the desserts as well. Most of the desserts were gone within a few minutes, haha! They delivered everything herself and set up the table for me. They were also very flexible and met with me at the bakery whenever I asked, even when the bakery was closed. Thank you The Family Bakery for your hard work and great services. We will definitely be in touch for future orders,:)"</strong></div>

      <div class="user-comment"><strong>"The Family Bakery is super easy to work with, professional, and flexible! I love that they are a family run business and have always been able to take my cake/dessert orders even on short notice! Recent birthday cakes I ordered were exactly as I requested and the guests loved the flavors!"</strong></div>

      <div class="user-comment"><strong>"Scrumptious is simply incredible! They make the most creative, beautiful and delicious treats with a truly original artistic flair. I had the pleasure of working with them through Icing Smiles, and organization that provides memorable treats for sick kids. What blew me away were the amazing photos of the hand painted macarons, rocket ship cakes, and magazine worthy sweet tables for events. If you want something that is truly memorable, this is the place"</strong></div>

      <div class="user-comment"><strong>"The red velvet cake pops were amazing! I absolutely loved them and they went fast! People were surprised when they realized it isn't a typical cake pop. I wasn't sure too sure if it would be a hit with the coworkers, but they went for seconds! And were proportionally exhausted from the sugar crash that followed the party. It's my first time ordering from The Family Bakery for a work baby shower, thanks to my sister-in-law's recommendation from a while back. It's become my new favorite treat. An awesome creative treat for any crowd and any event. I am definitely going to order from them again for future events!"</strong></div>

      <div class="user-comment"><strong>"I am a bride and was in the market for a bakery to make my cake. I was drawn to The Family Bakery's bright neon yellow sign and decided to come here with my friend one day. I had such an incredible experience! I will never forget how nicely I was treated! They were amazing! They sat down with us right away and talked over every detail, asked me many questions about what I want, and gave me every piece of information I needed including the exact price of how much everything would be with taxes and delivery. I was left very satisfied! The prices are kinda high but its very worth it. You will also be getting amazing desserts such as macaroons, tiramisu, custom made cookies and more! Best place ever! Definitely go here!"</strong></div>
